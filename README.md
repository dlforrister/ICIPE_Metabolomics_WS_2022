# Three Day Metabolomics Training Course (October 24-26, 2022)

## Description
This workshop will provide training in metabolomic data analyses for graduate students and early-career scientists from sub-Saharan African, working on a variety of plant and animal species. Participants will gain skills for collecting, analyzing and sharing metabolomic data, focusing in particular on data analyses using freely available software. Participants will also gain scientific communication skills through paper discussions and a poster session. Support for this workshop is provided by a grant from the JRS Biodiversity Foundation.

## Training Location

## Pre-course requirements
We have a lot of information to cover and just three days to do it. To maximize the value of this workshop, all participants are asked to do the following steps prior to attending the workshop:
### Download and install the following programs on your personal laptop computer
1. R and R studio: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
     If you already have them installed, please take the time to update to the latest versions!!

     - Workshop activities require participants to be familiar with the R programming language.  If you do not routinely use this program please work through the following [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) modules prior to the workshop:
       - [Intro to R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html)
       - [Starting with data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html)
       - [Manipulating data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
       - [Visualizing data modules](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html)
2. Register for GNPS: https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/user/register.jsp

3. Install Sirius https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/ 
     - install the SIRIUS+CSI:FingerID GUI and CLI - Version 5.5.7 (2022-07-13) about halfway down the above page
     - Once installed, start Sirius and follow the prompts to create an account. 
     - Make sure to verify your email!
4. CLONE this github repository and install required packages
     - Click the green "CODE" button in the upper right above the readme 
 

### Download - use file we email u- Oscript. run it to install everything...
Please download the practice datasets and code prior to traveling to ICIPE for the workshop.  You will need these files for the hands-on analysis training.

Due to file size limitations, we have to download the folder from google drive. 
1) Please Download the this script ["0_Pre_Course_package_installation" https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EbzSDooUh2ZFRy8WTGHrZ-g5NhHF4Fks?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YjdxpzZIFGORDCuIkEKKKNZnnUZSEWG1/view?usp=sharing)
     (Right click on the folder name and click download)
2) Navigate to this folder and open the "ICIPE_Ecometabolomics.Rproj" file with RStudio.
3) Within Rstudio navigate to or open the R Notebook "/code/0_Pre_Course_package_installation.Rmd". Run this entire notebook to make sure all packages are installed

### Read the journal club papers:

(PDFs found in Journal_Club_PDFs folder)

1. Paper 1: [Wiggins et al 2016](https://github.com/dlforrister/Forrister_Metabolomics_WS/blob/main/Journal_Club_PDFs/Wiggins2016.pdf) Quantitative and qualitative shifts in defensive metabolites define chemical defense investment during leaf development in Inga, a genus of tropical trees.
2. Paper 2: [Sedio et al 2021](https://github.com/dlforrister/Forrister_Metabolomics_WS/blob/main/Journal_Club_PDFs/Sedio2021.pdf). Chemical Similarity of Co-occurring Trees Decreases With Precipitation and Temperature in North American Forests. 
3. Paper 3: [Endara et al 2018](https://github.com/dlforrister/Forrister_Metabolomics_WS/blob/main/Journal_Club_PDFs/Endara2018.pdf) Chemocoding as an identification tool where morphological‐ and DNA‐based methods fall short: Inga as a case study.

You will work with other participants to present one of these papers during the Journal Club activity.  You will be given your assigned journal club group and paper approximately one week before the workshop. You will have time to meet with your group prior to presenting your paper, however this time is limited so please carefully read your assigned journal club paper and prepare answers to the following questions: 
- What are the authors' goals and/or hypotheses?
- What specific methods did the authors use to acheive these goals or test these hypotheses?
- Are these methods similar or different than the approaches we have discussed in the workshop?
- What did they find? 
- Do you agree with their interpretation of their results?
- Why do you think we picked this paper for the Journal Club?


### COVID Policies
Participants should have proof of full COVID-19 vaccination prior to the workshop.
