# Three Day Metabolomics Training Course (October 24-26, 2022)

## Description
This workshop will provide training in metabolomic data analyses for graduate students andearly-career scientists from sub-Saharan African, working on a variety of plant and animal species. Participants will gain skills for collecting, analyzing and sharing metabolomic data, focusing in particular on data analyses using freely available software. Participants will also gain scientific communication skills through paper discussions and a poster session. Support for this workshop is provided by a grant from the JRS Biodiversity Foundation.

## Training Location
Duduville Campus, icipe, Kasarani, Kenya:

## Pre-course requirements
We have a lot of information to cover and just three days to do it. To maximize the value of this workshop, all participants are asked to do the following steps prior to attending the workshop:
### Download and install the following programs on your personal laptop computer
1. R and R studio: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
     - Workshop activities require participants to be familiar with the R programming language.  If you do not routinely use this program please work through the following [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) modules prior to the workshop:
       - [Intro to R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html)
       - [Starting with data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html)
       - [Manipulating data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
       - [Visualizing data modules](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html)
2. program 2
3. program 3

### Download datasets and code
Please download the practice datasets and code prior to traveling to ICIPE for the workshop.  You will need these files for the hands-on analysis training.
1. Code 1
2. Code 2
3. Dataset1
4. Dataset2

### Download and read these three papers:
1. Paper 1: [Wiggins et al 2016](Wiggins2016.pdf) Quantitative and qualitative shifts in defensive metabolites define chemical defense investment during leaf development in Inga, a genus of tropical trees.
2. Paper 2: [Sedio et al 2021](Sedio2021.pdf). Chemical Similarity of Co-occurring Trees Decreases With Precipitation and Temperature in North American Forests. 
3. Paper 3: [Endara et al 2018](Endara2018.pdf) Chemocoding as an identification tool where morphological‐ and DNA‐based methods fall short: Inga as a case study.

You will work with other participants to present one of these papers during the Journal Club activity.  You will be given your assigned journal club group and paper approximately one week before the workshop. You will have time to meet with your group prior to presenting your paper, however this time is limited so please carefully read your assigned journal club paper and prepare answers to the following questions: 
- What are the authors' goals and/or hypotheses?
- What specific methods did the authors use to acheive these goals or test these hypotheses?
- What did they find? 
- Do you agree with their interpretation of their results?
- Why do you think we picked this paper for the Journal Club?


### COVID Policies
Participants should have proof of full COVID-19 vaccination prior to the workshop.
Please upload your COVID-19 vaccination information here: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
